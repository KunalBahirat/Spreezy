                <p>
                    Contaminated water is the most common cause of illness to mankind. Around 60% of diseases caused to humans are water-borne with children below 5 years more susceptible. One of the most usual ways water getting contaminated is through water storage tanks - the cleaning of which is either neglected or inappropriate means like the services of a local plumber or sweeper are engaged.
                    </p><p>
                    Though Water Purifiers form an integral part in every home, they are not maintained in effective working condition due to regular maintenance and cleaning of filters. A clean water source enhances the life of the components of water purifiers, making them more effective. In addition to drinking, water is used for other household chores like cooking, washing & bathing. If the input water is not clean, we can still be exposed to water borne diseases.</p>
                    <p>
                    Large quantities of clean water will be required to clean and treat storage tanks and tankers before they can be used to store water.</p>
